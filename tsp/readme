This folder corresponds to the tsp problem of the project


usage: tsp.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-n NCITY] [--delta_t DELTA_T] [--u0 U0]
              [--itercnt ITERCNT] [--termthresh TERMTHRESH] [--nonint]
              [--noplot] [--retry RETRY]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE
  -n NCITY, --ncity NCITY
  --delta_t DELTA_T     This is the analogue of the step size/learning rate
  --u0 U0               This is the gain value. It decides how drastic the
                        activation function is. A lower value implies a more
                        drastic curve.
  --itercnt ITERCNT     This is the number of iterations that is run before we
                        ask if we wish to continue or not.
  --termthresh TERMTHRESH
                        This is the threshold value used for seeing if that
                        city has to be used for that location in the tour or
                        not
  --nonint              Set this flag so that continuously keep runnning till
                        the termination is met
  --noplot              Set this flag so that we don't generate any plots at
                        the end of execution.
  --retry RETRY         The number of times we need to retry the method. So
                        each time we use a different random starting point so
                        that we might converge on error. The default is 0
                        retries => 1 pass



examples:

python3.5 tsp.py --delta_t 0.000001 --u0 0.01 --itercnt 2000 --termthresh 0.1 --retry 15 --noplot --nonint
